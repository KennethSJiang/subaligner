Welcome to Subaligner's documentation!
======================================

Given an out-of-sync subtitle file along with a piece of audiovisual content carrying speeches described by it,
Subaligner provides a one-stop solution on automatic subtitle synchronisation with a pretrained deep neural network and forced
alignments. In essence, aligning subtitles is a dual-stage process with a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network trained
upfront. Subaligner helps subtitlers not only in preprocessing raw subtitle materials (outcome from stenographers or
STT workflow, etc.) but also in gaining quality control over their work within subtitle post-production. This tool
also tolerates errors occurred in live subtitles which sometimes do not completely or correctly represent what people
actually spoke in the companion audiovisual content.

Subligner has been shifted with a command-line interface which helps users to conduct various tasks around subtitle synchronisation
without writing any code as well as APIs targeting developers. With existing audiovisual and in-sync subtitle files at
hand, users can train their own synchroniser with a single command and zero setup. A handful of subtitles formats are supported
and can be converted from one to another either during synchronisation or on on-demand.

The source code can be found on GitHub: `subaligner <https://github.com/baxtree/subaligner>`_.
